# TC-WAR
creating the card game war in python
This is test from gitBash
1- create a object class for the deck
#deck has 52 cards
#deck is randomily shuffled at the beggining of every game
#each player gets half of the cads in the beggining (26)
2- create a object class for the cards (can be just one with various definitions)
#cards are ,4*A ,4*K ,4*Q ,4*J ,4*10 ,4*9 ,4*8 ,4*7 ,4*6 ,4*5 ,4*4 ,4*3, 4*2
#in the battle the bigger the number allways wins
3-make the random distribution of the 52 cards
# 26 cards for each polayer
#maybe a list of random cards 
#this list as to keep the same order through the game
#the player cannot see his cards
4- make the game run without the war element
#every turn two cards are played
#the player with the bigger card wins

5-make the war element of the game
#1 card down and one turned up
#compete to see whos the ighest
#if they are equal restart
6- create the winning condition(in this case the total absortion of the deck by one player?)
#????
7- give out a victory message
#You are victorious
