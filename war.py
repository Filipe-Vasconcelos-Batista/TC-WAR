#creating the card game war in python  

#1- create a object class for the deck #deck has 52 cards 
#deck is randomily shuffled at the beggining of every game 
#each player gets half of the cads in the beggining (26) 


#2- create a object class for the cards (can be just one with various definitions) 
#cards are ,4A ,4K ,4Q ,4J ,410 ,49 ,48 ,47 ,46 ,45 ,44 ,43, 4*2
 #in the battle the bigger the number allways wins 


#3-make the random distribution of the 52 cards
#26 cards for each polayer
#maybe a list of random cards #this list as to keep the same order through the game
#the player cannot see his cards 4- make the game run without the war element 
#every turn two cards are played #the player with the bigger card wins


#5-make the war element of the game 
#1 card down and one turned up 
#compete to see whos the highest #if they are equal restart 


#6- create the winning condition(in this case the total absortion of the deck by one player?)
 #???? 


#7- give out a victory message
#You are victorious
